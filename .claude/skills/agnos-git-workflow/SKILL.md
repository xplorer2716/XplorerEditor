# AGNOS Git Workflow (Claude Code entry point)

This is a thin pointer, kept in sync with the canonical procedure so the AGNOS process has a
single source of truth (RQ-PRT-004). Read and follow the full procedure — sub-commands
`start-session <TRI>` and `commit-task <TASK-ID> [<ADR-ID>] <description>`, ID validation, and
platform-aware script dispatch — at:

`.github/skills/agnos-git-workflow/SKILL.md`

Do not duplicate that procedure here; if it and this file ever disagree, the `.github` version is
authoritative.
